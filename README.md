# BRAND MASHUP -

### About

This is a projdct in which we were assigned to do some unique task by combining
two different products. ***COORS BEER*** and ***KLEENEX WET WIPES*** are the products we selected.
Here, the scenario is to create beer brand but we have to use all the styling elements of ***Coors Beer*** such as label styling, font-styles, colour swatches, typography etc. and replace the content of the ***Coors Beer*** with the information of ***Kleenex Wetwipes***.

Final step is to represent our brand worldwide and because of that, we have created a website for
this brand which will give more information about the company, trendy and most liked beers, process-
how beer is made?, and place where use can contact us to solve their inquires or doubts.

We have to make project responsive this time as well as to create ```three POPOVER``` using javascript
which is somehow new and challenging to us.
